  <h1>Introduction to optimization algorithms</h1>
  <dt-byline class="l-page"></dt-byline>


  <h2>Mathematical Optimization</h2>
  <p><i>Mathematical Optimization is the branch of mathematics that aims to solve the problem of finding the elements that maximize or minimize a given function</i>. Its importance stems from the fact that many problems in engineering and machine learning can be cast as mathematical optimization problems. For example, in a spam detection filter we might aim to find the system that minimizes the number of misclassified emails. Similarly, when an engineer designs a pipe, we will seek for the design that minimizes cost while respecting some safety constraints. Both are examples that can be modeled as optimization problems.
  </p>

  <p><b>Note</b>: Optimization is a broad field. This lecture will be exclusively about <i>gradient-based</i> optimization methods. </p>

  <!-- <p>The birth of modern mathematical optimization is dated to the military services early in World War II. Other names for mathematical optimization mainly used during this initial period include "mathematical programming" and "operations research". Key figures of the initial period are Soviet economist Leonid Kantorovich<dt-cite key="kantorovich1940new"></dt-cite> and George Dantzig<dt-cite key="dantzig1951maximization"></dt-cite>. </p>

<figure>
  <img style="margin-left:50px;  width: 400px" src="http://worldwar2headquarters.com/images/normandy/landingCraft/armored-warfare.jpg" alt="">
 <figcaption id="expander" style="position:absolute; left:490px; top:30px; width:220px">Because of the war effort, there was an urgent need to allocate scarce resources
to different military operations in an effective manner. The British and then the U.S.
military management called upon a large number of scientists to apply some scientific approach for this strategic problems. The newly developed tools were
instrumental in winning the Air Battle of Britain and, later, played a major role in managing
antisubmarine operations for winning the Battle of the North Atlantic.
</figcaption>
</figure> -->


<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>Given an extended real-valued function $f: \RR^p \to \RR$, the general problem of finding the value that minimizes this function is written as follows
</p>
<p style="background-color: #D2E4FC; padding: 1px; border-radius: 8px;">\begin{equation}\label{eq:fw_objective}
  \minimize_{\boldsymbol{x} \in \RR^p} f(\boldsymbol{x}) ~,
\end{equation}</p>
<p>In this context, $f$ is the <i>objective function</i> (sometimes referred to as loss function, cost function or energy).</p>

<!-- <p>The beauty of optimization is that it allows to abstract from the details of the problem. Once posed within the optimization framework, we can use all its machinery to solve the problem without caring about where the problem came from. This has key advantages: we do not need to develop algorithms for each method separately, instead, the methods developed for a particular algorithm can be applied to any instance of of the same class of problems.</p> -->



  <h2>The rules of the game</h2>

  <p>Consider the following 2-dimensional optimization problem, with
$$
\minimize_{x \in \RR^2}\, \underbrace{(1 - x_1)^2 + 100(x_2 - x_1^2)^2}_{= f(x)}~.
$$
Since the <i>domain</i> of the objective function is a 2-dimensional space, we can visualize this objective function as an image in 2-D, where the color (darker=lower value) encodes the value of the objective function.
  </p>
  <figure style = "position:relative; width:984px; height:300px;">
    <div id="banana" style="position:relative; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);"></div>
  </figure>
  <p>A naive approach is to evaluate the function at a discrete grid and then just select the value that minimize the cost function. However, this approach is very inefficient: the number of function evaluation it requires is exponential in the number of dimensions.
  </p>

  <p>Let $n$ be the grid size in each dimension. Then this approach requires
$
n^d
$
function evaluations. Since we aim to solve problems with large $d$ (in the thousands if not millions), we need more efficient methods.</p>

  <p>A more efficient approach instead is to start from an initial guess and iteratively refine the initial guess. The information that to which we have access is the objective function value and its gradient
  </p>
  <figure style = "position:relative; width:984px; height:300px;">
    <div id="banana2" style="position:relative; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);"></div>
  </figure>
  <!-- <p>
  Like a hiker on a foggy day, we seek to reach the bottom of the valley while relying only on local information such as the value and steep (gradient) of the objective function at the current iterate.
  </p> -->

to choose the right tool.</p>

<p>The scale of an optimization problem is pretty much set by the

on which the search is performed.</p>

<p><strong>Optimizing smooth functions is easier</strong>
(true in the context of general function, otherwise
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">Linear Programming</a>
is an example of methods which deal very efficiently with
piece-wise linear functions).</p>
<p>Smooth functions have the crucial property that at each point admit a quadratic upper bound. I.e., there exists $0 \leq L < \infty$ such that the following inequality is verified for all $\xx, \yy$ in the domain:
\begin{equation}
f(\yy) \leq f(\xx) + \langle \nabla f(\xx), \yy - \xx\rangle + \frac{L}{2}\|\xx - \yy\|^2
\end{equation}

<div class="topic">
<p>Many optimization methods rely on gradients of the objective function.
If the gradient function is not given, they are computed numerically,
which induces errors. In such situation, even if the objective
function is not noisy, a gradient-based optimization may be a noisy
optimization.</p>

  The speed of convergence of most optimization depend on the <i>conditioning</i> of our problem. A well conditioned problem is one in which the curvature is similar among any direction. A badly conditioned problem is one in which the level curves

<h2>Recommended Readings</h2>
<p>
At the undergrade level I recommend the book Convex Optimization Algorithms by Dimitry Bertsekas<dt-cite key="bertsekas2015convex"></dt-cite>.
</p>
<p>At a more advanced level, the book by Nesterov<dt-cite key="nesterov2013introductory"></dt-cite> is also an excelleng resource.</p>
